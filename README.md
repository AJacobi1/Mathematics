General Usage
-------------
This simple piece of software is designed to be able to take user input of two integers and add them together to output the sum of said integers. This software does not work with decimals and will need to be altered to include the variable 'double' instead of 'int' if you would like to do so.

Using
-----
This program requires two inputs from the user. It will start off by providing static text that will ask the user to "enter two numbers". Type the first integer and press enter to store this in the array. Then repeat for the second integer to store. After the second integer has been input and enter pressed, the program will output the sum of the two integers.
